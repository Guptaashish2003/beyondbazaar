        KUMAR GUPTA believes in helping its customers as far as possible, and
        has therefore a liberal cancellation policy. Under this policy: •
        Cancellations will be considered only if the request is made immediately
        after placing the order. However, the cancellation request may not be
        entertained if the orders have been communicated to the
        vendors/merchants and they have initiated the process of shipping them.
        • RAMESH KUMAR GUPTA does not accept cancellation requests for
        perishable items like flowers, eatables etc. However, refund/replacement
        can be made if the customer establishes that the quality of product
        delivered is not good. • In case of receipt of damaged or defective
        items please report the same to our Customer Service team. The request
        will, however, be entertained once the merchant has checked and
        determined the same at his own end. This should be reported within 2
        Days days of receipt of the products. In case you feel that the product
        received is not as shown on the site or as per your expectations, you
        must bring it to the notice of our customer service within 2 Days days
        of receiving the product. The Customer Service Team after looking into
        your complaint will take an appropriate decision. • In case of
        complaints regarding products that come with a warranty from
        manufacturers, please refer the issue to them. In case of any Refunds
        approved by the RAMESH KUMAR GUPTA, it’ll take 6-8 Days days for the
        refund to be processed to the end customer.Cancellation & Refund Policy
